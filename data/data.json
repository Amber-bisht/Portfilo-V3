Implemented reusable UI components, integrated RESTful APIs, and collaborated closely with backend services to ensure smooth data flow and performance optimization. Containerized the entire application using Docker, creating consistent and reproducible development, testing, and production environments, which simplified deployments, reduced environment-specific issues, and improved overall release reliability.",
